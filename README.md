L-System Rendering
====================
A project that aims to progmatically render L-systems through a custom turtle graphics library, given the L-systems production rules and associated meanings.

Currently supported L-systems:
-------------------------------
* Koch curve
* Dragon curve
* Sierpinski triangle

All currently support L-systems are shown as functions in Main.kt as an example.
