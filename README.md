L-System Rendering
====================
A project that aims to progmatically render L-systems through a custom turtle graphics library, given the L-systems production rules and associated meanings.

Current L-system grammar rules supported:
------------------------------------------
* Move forward x units
* Rotate x degrees in y direction
* Push current position and angle to stack
* Pop current position and angle from stack

Current L-system examples:
-------------------------------
* Koch curve
* Dragon curve
* Sierpinski triangle
* Fractal plant example from Wikipedia
* Bushy plant example from http://berniepope.id.au/lsystem.html

All L-systems examples are shown in the examples directory.
